# Homework 01

## Introducing Jenn 

I am a **fourth year** and my two majors are Sociology, *and* History, Philosophy, Social Studies of Science & Medicine. I love cooking and spending too much time buying things I don't need on Amazon. Over the summer I distributed my time playing Animal Crossing and working as a research intern at Brookings.

Some other things I like:

* Solidcore
* When the line of code runs
* Podcasts
* npr
